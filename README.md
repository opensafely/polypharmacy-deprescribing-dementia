# File details
Deatils of the purpose for each file in this repository are outlined below


- The most up to date version of the protocol can be found in the ['protocols'](./protocols/) folder.

- The [`codelists`](./codelists) folder contains  [`codelists/codelists.txt`](./codelists/codelists.txt), a full list of all codelists used in this project. Each of the .CSV for those codelists can also be found in this folder.

- The following scripts are in the [`analysis`](./analysis) directory:
    - The [`dataset_definition`](./analysis/dataset_definition/) directory contains the scripts for generating the initial raw dataset for the project. 
        - ['codelists.py'](./analysis/dataset_definition/codelists.py) loads each codelist that is needed.
        - [`dataset_definition.py`](./analysis/dataset_definition/dataset_definition.py) defines the variables that will be used for analysis and the poulation defintion
    - The [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) directory contains the scripts for cleaning the raw dataset into an analysis ready dataset. 
        - [`dataset_clean.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/dataset_clean.R) is the main script whcih calls functions from each of the other scripts in this folder.
        - The funtion in ['fn-modify_dummy.R'](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-modify_dummy.R) is called first and is used to alter the dummy data generated by opensafely to something close to what we expect the population dataset to look like.
        - The function in ['fn-inex.R'](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-inex.R) applies the inclusion and excusion criteria for the study.
        - The other functions in this folder (for QA, preprocessing etc) have not yet been written.

- The ['project.yaml'](./project.yaml) file lists all actions to be run in OpenSAFELY and their run order
