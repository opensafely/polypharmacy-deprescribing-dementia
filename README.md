# File details
Deatils of the purpose for each file in this repository are outlined below


- The most recent version of the protocol can be found in the [`protocols`](./protocols/) folder.

- The [`codelists`](./codelists) folder contains  [`codelists/codelists.txt`](./codelists/codelists.txt), a full list of all codelists used in this project. Each of the .CSV for those codelists can also be found in this folder.

- The following scripts are in the [`analysis`](./analysis) directory:
    - The [`dataset_definition`](./analysis/dataset_definition/) directory contains the scripts for generating the initial raw dataset for the project. 
        - [`codelists.py`](./analysis/dataset_definition/codelists.py) loads each codelist that is needed.
        - [`create_variables.py`] contains functions for creating variables for the inclusion / exclusion criteria, covariates and outcome variables
        - The `dataset_definition_*.py` files define the study population and analysis variables for different stages of the pipeline. Each script generates a specific dataset using EHRQL, in some cases building on outputs from earlier data generation or cleaning steps.
        - [`variable_helper_functions.py`] contains various functions to help facilitate other scripts in this directory.
    - The [`dataset_clean`](./analysis/dataset_clean/) directory contains the scripts for cleaning the raw dataset into an analysis ready dataset. 
        - The `dataset_clean_*.R` scripts clean and process the datasets generated by the `dataset_definition_*.py` files at different stages of the pipeline. These scripts apply consistent data cleaning, derive additional variables, and produce analysis-ready datasets and flow outputs, often passing cleaned data forward to later steps (e.g. matching or final analysis).
        - The function in [`fn-modify_dummy.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-modify_dummy.R) is called first and is used to alter the dummy data generated by opensafely to something close to what we expect the population dataset to look like.
        - [`fn-preprocess.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-preprocess.R) is the function carrying out initial preprocessing, formatting columns correctly
        - [`fn-qa.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-qa.R) is the quality assurance function
        - The function in [`fn-inex.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-inex.R) applies the inclusion and excusion criteria for the study.
        - [`fn-ref.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/fn-ref.R) is the function that sets the reference levels for factors. 
- [`utility.R`] contains miscellaneous functions used in the analysis.

- The [`project.yaml`](./project.yaml) file lists all actions to be run in OpenSAFELY and their run order

- [`create_table1.R`](./analysis/table1/create_table1.R) generates a csv file for table one for the study. This uses the output of [`dataset_clean.R`](./analysis/dataset_clean/dataset_clean.R) to describe the patient characteristics, displaying the proportion of study population in each variable category.

- **Suffixes used in dataset scripts**  
  The `dataset_definition_*.py` and `dataset_clean_*.R` files use consistent suffixes to indicate the dataset or stage they relate to:

  - `_inex_prematch` - initial dataset applying inclusion/exclusion criteria before any matching.
  - `_hist` - dataset including historical data variables.
  - `_match` - dataset prepared for matching.
  - `_inex_matched` - dataset after matching with inclusion/exclusion criteria applied.
  - `_matched_full` - dataset after matching with including all variables needed for the modelling.

  These suffixes help track the flow of data through the pipeline, showing which datasets are inputs to later cleaning, matching, or analysis steps.
